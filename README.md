## Legal
"Microsoft", "DirectX" and "Windows" are ©,® and/or ™ [Microsoft Corporation](https://www.microsoft.com/).

Software licenses for each package are provided in this repository and are also bundled with every software package.

# Rationale
Users of older Microsoft Windows operating systems may require access to older versions of Microsoft redistributables in order to run their games and other apps.

These can be a pain to find, so as I find them I shall upload them.
